        <h1>Pavan kalyan Busha acts in a play</h1>
        <h3> Hedda Gabler Act 4- <i>"Henrik Ibsen"</i></h3>
        <p>HEDDA.

            Can I not help you in any way?
            </p>
        <p>MISS TESMAN.

            Oh, you must not think of it! Hedda Tesman must have no hand in such
            mournful work. Nor let her thought dwell on it either--not at this time.
            </p>
        <p>HEDDA.

            One is not always mistress of one's thoughts--
            </p>
        <p>MISS TESMAN.

            [Continuing.] Ah yes, it is the way of the world. At home we shall be
            sewing a shroud; and here there will soon be sewing too, I suppose--but
            of another sort, thank God!
            
            
              GEORGE TESMAN enters by the hall door.
            </p>
        <p>HEDDA.

            Ah, you have come at last!
            </p>
        <p>TESMAN.

            You here, Aunt Julia? With Hedda? Fancy that</p>
        <p>MISS TESMAN.

            I was just going, my dear boy. Well, have you done all you promised?</p>
