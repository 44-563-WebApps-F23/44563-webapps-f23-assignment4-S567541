        <h1>Pavan kalyan Busha acts in a play</h1>
        <h3> Hedda Gabler Act 4- <i>"Henrik Ibsen"</i></h3>
        <h3>HEDDA</h3> 
        <p> Can I not help you in any way?</p>
            <h3>MISS TESMAN</h3>
            <p>Oh, you must not think of it! Hedda Tesman must have no hand in such
            mournful work. Nor let her thought dwell on it either--not at this time</p>
            <h3>HEDDA</h3>
            
            <p> One is not always mistress of one's thoughts-- </p>
            <h3>MISS TESMAN</h3>

            <p>[Continuing.] </p>
            <p>Ah yes, it is the way of the world. At home we shall be
            sewing a shroud; and here there will soon be sewing too, I suppose--but
            of another sort, thank God!<h3> GEORGE TESMAN</h3> enters by the hall door.
            </p>
            <h3>HEDDA</h3>
            <p>Ah, you have come at last! </p>
            <h3>TESMAN</h3>
            
            <p>You here, Aunt Julia? With Hedda? Fancy that</p>

            <h3>MISS TESMAN</h3>
            <p>I was just going, my dear boy. Well, have you done all you promised?</p>
